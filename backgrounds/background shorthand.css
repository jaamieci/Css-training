/* CSS background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property.
This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing: */
body {
    background: #ffffff;
    background-image: url("img_tree.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right top;
  }

  /* You can use the shorthand property background: */
  body {
    background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
  }


/* When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

    background-color
    background-image
    background-repeat
    background-attachment
    background-position

It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order.
Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value. */
