/* Margin Collapse
Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to
the largest of the two margins.

This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins! */

h1 {
    margin: 0 0 50px 0;
  }
  
  h2 {
    margin: 20px 0 0 0;
  }

/* In the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px and the <h2> element has a top margin set to 20px. */
/* Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1> and the <h2> would be a total
of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse,the actual margin ends up being 50px. */
